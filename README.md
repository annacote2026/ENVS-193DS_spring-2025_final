# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final
Final for Spring 2025

## General Information

This repo is for the ENVS 193DS Spring 2025 Final.

This repo is mine (Github username: annacote2026).

## Data and file information

There are two folders, a 'code' folder and a 'data' folder. All code is in the 'code' folder, and all datasets are in the 'data' folder.

Within the 'data' folder there are two imported datasets that I utilized for data analysis and visualizations. 'occdist.csv' was sourced from the 2021 study by Dejan Stojanovic et al. titled "Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird" and 'SST_update2023.csv' was sourced from the SBC LTER data catalog under "Sea Surface Temperature in SB Channel".

Within the code folder, there is the quarto template I created, 'ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final.qmd' and the rendered html document, 'ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final.html'.

The Rproj that contains all code and data from this analysis can be found in the root directory, and is titled 'ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final.Rproj'.

This README also exists in the root directory as 'README.md'.
